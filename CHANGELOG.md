## [3.0.0] - 2025-06-11

### ðŸŽ‰ Complete Minecraft Clone - Advanced Voxel World System

#### Major Features Implemented

- **Complete Voxel World**: Infinite world generation with 16x16x256 chunks
- **Advanced Procedural Terrain**: Multi-biome terrain generation using FastNoise
- **Multiple Block Types**: Grass, dirt, stone, water, sand, wood, leaves, and more
- **Block Interaction System**: Raycasting-based block placement and destruction
- **Water Transparency**: Proper alpha blending for transparent water blocks
- **Chunk-Based Rendering**: Optimized mesh generation with frustum culling
- **Performance Optimization**: Dynamic chunk loading/unloading with 60+ FPS
- **UI System**: ImGui integration with debug panels and hotbar

#### Technical Architecture

- **World Management**: Complete chunk manager with background loading
- **Mesh Generation**: Optimized face culling and vertex buffer management
- **Shader System**: Enhanced fragment shader with texture atlas support
- **Camera System**: First-person camera with smooth movement and mouse look
- **Input Handling**: Comprehensive keyboard/mouse controls for world interaction

#### Performance Improvements
